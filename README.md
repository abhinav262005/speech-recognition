# Info about the project

Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), is the technology that allows machines or computers to understand and process human speech. It converts spoken language into text using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques. Hereâ€™s how it works in a nutshell:

Input: A microphone captures the sound waves of your voice.

Preprocessing: The audio is cleaned and broken down into smaller units (like phonemes) for easier processing.

Feature Extraction: Key characteristics of the speech, such as pitch, tone, and frequency, are analyzed.

Pattern Matching: The system compares these features to its language model and dictionary, attempting to match the sounds to words.

Output: The recognized speech is converted into text that can be displayed or used for commands.
